# Melbourne-Airbnb-Pricing-Model----R-Statistics-
Used a data set on Kaggle that includes Airbnb data in greater Melbourne, Australia. The information includes property type, descriptions, ratings, amenities, neighborhood, address, price, number of guests allowed, cancellation policies, among others.   

I used R to do data cleaning, exploratory plotting and analysis, text analysis(extracting information from the descriptions), interaction and correlation analysis between pairs of variables, forward and backward selection of regression modeling, and finally constructed a pricing model based on all these exploration. I also merged the data set with the housing data of Melbourne to help predict the Airbnb property price using the housing price in similar locations. Besides, I created a interactive map window that shows the property prices of each location, which could be a smarter and straightforward tool for the owners to find a reasonable price range.
